# webpack-es6-starter
> ez webpackin'

This is a skeleton template for getting started with webpack and es6.  
Webpack will bundle & compile everything under `src` to something your browser actually supports.  

This repo also contains [a react branch with a starter project](https://github.com/arno-s/webpack-es6-starter/tree/react).

## get it
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/arno-s/webpack-es6-starter.git
> npm install
> npm run serve
```
## commands
```bash
> npm run serve     #runs local development server
```
```bash
> npm run build     #builds to /dist-file for deployment
```
```bash
> npm run ib        #npm install and runs build
```

## important
don't forget to remove jquery if you don't use it from the `package.json`.
