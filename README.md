This is a skeleton template for getting started with webpack es6 and npm.  
With the [commands](#commands) listed here, webpack will bundle & compile everything under `src` to something your browser actually supports.  

## branches

## get it
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/arno-s/webpack-starter.git
> npm install
> npm run serve
```
## <a id="commands"></a>commands
```bash

```
```bash

```
```bash
> npm run ib        #run previous 2 commands
```
